This is the first post in my new Quarto blog. Welcome!

I followed this instruction to create my new Quarto blog: <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html>

Quarto is much more flexible and plays very well with R-Markdown documents. That's why I decided to migrate from my [old blog](http://philipppro.github.io/about/).

My old will not get any updates anymore and I will probably migrate some of the content from there.
